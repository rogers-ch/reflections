When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository allows multiple people to work on the project and all update the remote repository.  A remote repository also provides a backup in case something happens to your local machine, and it allows you to work on a project from multiple machines.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  This is important to make sure that you know the state of the files in your local repository so you don't accidentally lose work if someone else updates the remote repository and changes things you are actively working on.
