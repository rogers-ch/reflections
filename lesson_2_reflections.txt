Corey's Version Control Lesson 2 Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A new hidden git directory is created with git metadata.  You have to do this so git can track the changes to your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	This is a middle ground that holds the files that you are altering for the next commit.  It gives you a working space where you can make changes without affecting the files in the working directory and before moving the files into the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
